This repo contains the source code for cross-platform [.NET Core](http://github.com/dotnet/core) SDK. It aggregates the .NET Toolchain, the .NET Core runtime, the templates, the offline packages cache and the ASP.NET Runtime store. It produces zip and tarballs as well as the native packages for various supported platforms.

> **Note:** the dev/release/2.0.0 branch of the .NET Core SDK repo is based on an upcoming update of the SDK and is considered pre-release. For production-level usage, please use the
> released version of the tools available at https://dot.net/core

Installers and Binaries
-----------------------

You can download the .NET Core SDK as either an installer (MSI, PKG) or a zip (zip, tar.gz). The .NET Core SDK contains both the .NET Core runtime and CLI tools.

To download the .NET Core runtime **without** the SDK, visit https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup#daily-builds.

> **Note:** Be aware that the following installers are the **latest bits**. If you
> want to install the latest released versions, check out the [preceding section](#looking-for-v1-of-the-net-core-tooling).
