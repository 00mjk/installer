Contributing to .NET Command Line Interface
===========================================

The .NET Core  team maintains several guidelines for contributing to the .NET Core and associated repos, which are provided [on this link](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/contributing.md). Many of these are straightforward, while others may seem subjective. A .NET Core team member will be happy to explain why a guideline is defined as it is.
